Please write a program that does the following:
Read an input parameter with a JSON file name (for instance my_list.json)
The JSON will be in the following format (see below)

 Dictionary that will contain one nested hash and one list
 the hash will be of pairs of names and ages (name will be the key and age will be the value)
 the array will be a list of ages

the program will go over the list of people and divide them to buckets based on their ages
each bucket will hold all the names of the people with age between the partition key and the following partition key
bucket  ‘20-25’ will hold a list of name that their age is between 20 and 25 (not including)
this data will them be saved in a yaml format in a file with the same name as the input file with changed extension.

bonus - if there is someone that doesn't fall into any of the baskets it will create a new bucket based on the oldest person and add all the people that fall into this bucket

Sample input file:
{
    "ppl_ages":{
       "Dan": 102,
        "Dana": 2,
        "Danail": 5,
        "Dandre": 29,
        "Dane": 75,
        "Daneel": 22,
        "Danell": 57,
        "Dangelo": 35,
        "Danger": 11,
        "Danial": 25,
        "Danian": 82,
        "Daniel": 45,
        "Daniele": 23,
        "Danielius": 76,
        "Daniil": 23,
        "Danijel": 75,
        "Danilo": 25,

	},
	"buckets": [20,40,25,11]
